Developer Reference

  This reference is for people that would like to develop on GWT-OpenLayers itself.
  People that would just like to use GWT-OpenLayers in their projects should check out the {{{user-reference.html}user reference}}.

* Clone and go

  GWT-OpenLayers uses Mercurial for version control. For the uninitiated to Mercurial, check out the excellent {{{http://hginit.com/top/00.html}hginit tutorial}}, or read up in the {{{http://hgbook.red-bean.com/}hgbook}}.
  You can download a Mercurial commandline client {{{http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Download?action=show&redirect=BinaryPackages}here}}, or use an IDE plugin like {{{http://javaforge.com/project/HGE}MercurialEclipse}}.

  The easiest way to start developing on GWT-OpenLayers is by cloning the public central Mercurial repository:

+--
http://gwt-openlayers.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/gwt-openlayers/gwt-openlayers
+--


  This repository can be cloned anonymously.

  Once you cloned the public repository you got your own local copy of the repository to work with.
  If you want to contribute code, make sure you have tested your changes to an up-to-date copy (by pulling the latest changes), and send us your exported changesets.
  See this page about {{{http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommunicatingChanges}communicating changesets}}.


* Building GWT-OpenLayers from source

  Maven is used to build GWT-OpenLayers. Maven has good GWT support with the {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/}Maven GWT plugin}}.
  To build GWT-OpenLayers using Maven, open the commandline at gwt-openlayers-client and run:

+--
>mvn package
+--

  This produces a GWT module jar that you can use in GWT applications. The server side part (currently consisting of an Ajax Proxy for by-passing the same origin policy) is packaged in the same way.
