Changed the showcase example for ComparisonFilter.
If you use the fitler as a strategy then the filtering is done on the client side.
If the filter is used on the vector layer options then the filtering is sent in the WFS request so processing is done on the server side.
My use case prefers the processing to be done on the server side.
